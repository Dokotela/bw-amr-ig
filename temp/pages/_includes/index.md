# Botswana AMR Implementation Guide

This implementation guide defines FHIR profiles and value sets for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reporting in Botswana as part of the **Botswana AMR Data Analytics Platform** - a collaboration between the University of Botswana and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

## Background

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of drugs that once could successfully treat them. AMR now causes more deaths than HIV/AIDS and malaria worldwide and is estimated to be the number-5 leading cause of death in Botswana.

## Platform Overview

The Botswana AMR Data Analytics Platform leverages open source software to prevent and contain AMR through:

- Real-time electronic surveillance for early outbreak detection
- Data-driven deployment of prevention and control measures  
- Informed decision-making for clinicians and policymakers
- Centralized AMR data collection, analysis, and reporting

This FHIR Implementation Guide provides the technical foundation for standardized data exchange within the platform.
