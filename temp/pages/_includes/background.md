# AMR in Botswana

## The Challenge

- Reports of outbreaks and sporadic infections due to AMR are rising in Botswana
- Approximately 1 in 10 patients admitted to a hospital in Botswana will experience a Health-Associated-Infection
- AMR is now estimated to be the number-5 leading cause of death in Botswana

## Key AMR Reports in Botswana

### Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella in hospitalized newborns
Klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of bloodstream infection in hospitalized neonates in Botswana, with over 80% being multi-drug resistant.

### Carriage of multidrug-resistant organisms in the community
In a rectal carriage study among 2000 adults, 27.8% of participants were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant Enterobacterales (ESCRE)-colonized.

### Prolonged hospital outbreak with Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
Environmental reservoirs and ongoing transmission from environmental sources pose significant containment challenges.

### First report of Candida auris in Botswana
Prior to 2023, C. auris had never before been reported in Botswana, representing an emerging multi-drug-resistant pathogen.
